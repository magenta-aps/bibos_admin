* Version 2.1.0.1, October 25, 2013


New in this version:

- First production ready release.
- Make sure postinstall script does not fail due to APT locking. Prevent
  apt-check from running in the background - there's no need for UpdateManager
  to launch all of a sudden (ticket #9101).
- Battery indicator was missing on audience user's login (#9089). Enable Gnome-
  settings plugin for user (presumably this was previously disabled as an 
  attempt to solve #7875).
- Icons are sometimes jumbled (ticket #8279). We now don't try to specify the 
  location of default desktop icons - this seems to avoid the timing problem.
- BibOS client is updated to support wireless networking cards (ticket #8951).
- BibOS client is also updated to support fixed gateway which is not
  necessarily on the same network as BibOS clients (ticket #8847).
- Script to change background image did not work unless the audience user was
  logged in (ticket #9031).
- Login screen will no longer display the users' wallpaper when they are
  selected - only the default login background is shown (ticket #9091).
- Power settings turned off monitor at login screen (ticket #7875).
- BibOS specific admin scripts moved from the bibos_admin repository to
  admin_scripts/ in this repository.
- New boot image on install disk.
