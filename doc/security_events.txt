Security events - new functionality in BibOS Admin
==================================================

Aarhus has a desire to register and be able to receive an alert whenever
a keyboard is disconnected and connected, because some people have done
this in order to attach keyloggers to the devices. The purpose of that,
of course, could be to sniff credit card numbers and sensitive
passwords.

We wish to implement this in BibOS. As it is easy to imagine many other
kinds of security related threats, we will implement the general concept
of Security Event.

A security event basically has a Type (keyboard connected), a time and
place (date and computer on which it happened), and technical
information - e.g., the type of keyboard connected or the user
requesting a sudo operation.


Changes to the model
++++++++++++++++++++


A new Django model will be introduced in the Bibos Admin system. This
model will be called SecurityEvent and will basically have the following
fields (further analysis or actual implementation may show further
fields to be needed):

* Type - the kind of security event. Link to SecurityProblem, described
  below 
* Time - timestamp including date
* PC - the afflicted PC. Link to the PC class
* Technical summary - brand/type of keyboard, user performing login, etc
* Raw technical data from log.


The security event *type* will be another model, which could be called
SecurityProblem. The SecurityProblem model class will contain

* Code - a machine readable, unique identifier, e.g. "KEYBOARD"
* Name - e.g. "Keyboard connected"
* Level - Normal, High or Critical (green, yellow, red)
* Script - a script which may be run by the Job Manager on each machine
  to determine if this security event has occurred since we last
  checked.

SecurityProblems may be site specific or global. Maybe this should be
achieved by letting the Script field be a link to the existing Script
class.

The script will normally be a shell script written in Bash, but might in
fact be any executable, like a Python program or a C program compiled to
binary code. It will take no parameters, and its output MUST conform to
the specification hinted at below and developed as a part of the
completion of this task.

A computer is regularly checked for SecurityEvents, if the corresponding
SecurityProblem is associated with it. This association is through the
group and site levels, e.g.

* The Site object may be associated with a list of SecurityProblems,
  which are always checked for on each of the site's machines.
* The PCGroup object may be associated with a list of SecurityProblems,
  which are always checked for on each of the group's machines.
* The User Profile object will be associated with a list of
  SecurityProblems, for which this user wishes to receive email alerts.
  Users should be able to subscribe to these alerts on their profile
  pages.

On each computer, a check is performed for the security problems listed
on the site and on any of its groups.


Changes in the BibOS Admin GUI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Under the menu item "Maskiner" to the left of the current BibOS Admin
layout, a new point will be introduced, called "Sikkerhedsadvarsler".

This will contain a list of SecurityEvents which have not yet been taken
care of. It will be possible to indicate that an event will be taken
care of (and thus make it disappear from the list), and it will be
possible to filter by Level e.g. to only see the critical events. It
might also be possible to see events that have been take care of, but
that will not be the default setting.

Under the menu item "Scripting", a new point will be introduced, called
"Sikkerhedsproblemer". Here, it will be possible to set up security
problems, specifying their name, level, code and script.

When the script attached to a SecurityProblem is changed, it will be
pushed to the clients, next time they contact the admin system.

**Question:** Should the script be a link to the existing "script"
class? When creating a script we could indicate that this is a
SecurityProblem script and the programmer promises it obeys the protocol
for such scripts - meaning, the user will only be allowed to select one
of those scripts for the SecurityProblems. 


Changes in the JobManager protocol
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The main part of the JobManager program is currently to be found in the
function called run_pending_jobs().

Basically, it currently performs these functions: ::

    get_instructions()
    run_pending_jobs()

It should be modified to also run the new function
handle_security_events().

This will, in turn, call to new functions, one called
collect_security_events() and one called send_security_events().

The first of these will collect the security events occured since last
check and put them in a file. e.g.  /etc/bibos/security_check_YYYYMMDDHHmm.csv

This file will consist of a semicolon separated, properly escaped CSV
file. 

The scripts for each security event will be responsible for collecting
returning these data so they can easily be placed in these files. The
scripts could be run e.g. by running all the scripts in
/etc/bibos/security/scripts.

The send_security_events() function will collect the security events found
in this file and send to the server using a new function called
push_security_events().

This will be an XML-RPC function which will take a list of strings (the
lines in the CSV file), and on the server side, this function will
extract the data, create the corresponding SecurityEvents and send out
alert emails as needed.
