This directory contains the BibOS Admin system, which is a remote
administration system for Debian-based GNU/Linux-systems, especially
Ubuntu systems.

The system is developed for a number of public libraries in Denmark and
was specifically designed to manage their BibOS systems for audience PC.
Its functionality aims to be similar to that of Canonical's Landscape
product, but less ambitious.

The system was prepared by Magenta Aps: See http://www.magenta-aps.dk

HOWTO SETUP DEVELOPMENT SERVER
=============================+

This guide describes how to get the admin site up and running for
development purposes, i.e. with no Apache or proxy setup. If you wish to
set up a production environment, please follow the instructions in
doc/HOWTO_INSTALL_SERVER.txt. If you wish to learn to use the system,
please install server and use the on-site documentation.

Also check the guide to installing the client and preparing the server farther
below.


You should normally be able to  install the development server in  10
minutes or less. An Internet connection is required.



PRE-REQUISITES
++++++++++++++

Python 2.7
SQLite 3
python-virtualenv

Get them with apt-get install or by whatever means necessary for your
platform.


GRAB THE CODE
+++++++++++++

    git clone https://github.com/magenta-aps/bibos_admin.git

GET THE RIGHT BRANCH
++++++++++++++++++++

    cd bibos_admin

    git checkout <development>

This only applies if you're not working directly on the master branch
(which you probably shouldn't). For <development> substitute the branch
you want to work on.


INSTALL DJANGO AND OTHER COMPONENTS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


    cd admin_site

    scripts/install.sh

This requires an Internet connection. It should run its course with a
number of warnings but no errors.


SET UP AND RUN THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    scripts/post-install-dev.sh USERNAME EMAIL HOSTNAME/IP PORT

This sets up and runs the development version of the admin system (using a
local SQLite database). You'll be prompted for a password for the
new administrative user `USERNAME`.

PATCH THE USER
++++++++++++++

Log on to the admin site's user section, using the hostname, port, username and
password you specified:

http://localhost:8080/admin/auth/user/

Edit the user you just created. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and choose
"Super admin" as the user profile type. Click Save.



ENJOY
+++++

Go to http://localhost:8080 to start using the system - create sites,
create groups, etc. See further explanation below.

NOTE: The system was written in Django and consists of a Django site
with three apps: "account", "system" and "job". Most of the actual
functionality is concentrated in the "system"  app. Some knowledge of
Django is required to understand how the system is designed. Refer to
the graphical object model (BibOS.dia) for an explanation of the site's
object structure.



PREPARE THE ADMIN SYSTEM
========================


Create distribution
+++++++++++++++++++

You need to create a "distribution" in the BibOS Admin system.  This is
done in django-admin.  

The distribution ID needs to be a string with no spaces and preferrably
no special characters. It should reflect the operating system on the
corresponding clients, e.g. "ubuntu12.04".


Create Site 
+++++++++++

You need to create a "site" to which you can attach your client. The
name of the site should describe your location, and the ID should be a
simple, lowercase string with no spaces or special characters, e.g.
"aarhus".


Finalize the distribution
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This step is to be performed *after* you have registred a computer in the
admin system as described below. To finalize the distribution:

* Create a completely vanilla installation of the operating system you
  wish to define your "distribution", maybe with some additional
  packages which you wish to install on all your computers.

* Register the computer in the admin system as described below.

* When the registration is done, execute the command 

    bibos_upload_dist_packages

  in a command shell. This will upload the list of installed packages
  and register them as definition of this distribution.

* IMPORTANT: In the admin system's Django settings file, (e.g. in
  admin_system/bibos_admin/settings.py in the installed source code)
  close your distribution by adding its ID to the list
  CLOSED_DISTRIBUTIONS. 


REGISTER A CLIENT COMPUTER
==========================


Install bibos-client package
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First, you need to install the BibOS Admin client on the PC you wish to
control from the admin system.

We recommend that you install this from PyPI using pip.

Enter the following commands in a bash shell:

    # If not installed already
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install curl
    sudo apt-get install python-dev

    # This is what we want:
    sudo pip install bibos-client


After succesfully installing bibos-client, run the registration script
in order to connect with the admin system.

    sudo register_new_bibos_client.sh


Guide to the steps:

# Do not enter a gateway IP unless you *know* you will be using a gateway.
# Enter a new host name for your computer if you want. If not, your PC
  will be registered with its current name.
# Enter the ID for the site you wish to register the PC on (e.g.
  "aarhus").
# Enter the ID for the distribution (e.g. "ubuntu12.04").
# Enter the URL of your admin system (e.g. "http://localhost:8000" if
  you're a developer or "http://yourdomain.com/your_admin_dir".

The registration will now proceed, and your new PC will show up in the
admin system as "New" in the corresponding site's status list.

In order to start running scripts etc. on the computer, you need to
manually approve it's registration by "activating" it in the admin
system. View the details on the new computer and check the box marked
"Aktiv" or "Active". The PC will now start uploading its package info
and is under the control of the admin system.
